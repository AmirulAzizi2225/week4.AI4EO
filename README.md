# Week 4 AI4EO Assignment
## Echo Classification: Leads vs. Sea Ice and standard deviation of both classes

# Overview
This Github project aims to classify echoes into two distinct categories: Leads and Sea Ice, using unsupervised learning methods. The classification is performed on Sentinel-2 optical data and Sentinel-3 altimetry data, and the results are compared against the ESA official classification using a confusion matrix. 

# Dataset
- Satellite Data: Sentinel-2 optical data & Sentinel-3 altimetry data.
- Preprocessing: Data is preprocessed to extract relevant features for clustering and classification.

# Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
   - Load and clean the satellite data.
   - Extract echo features relevant for classification.
   
2. Unsupervised Classification (K-means Clustering)
   - Apply K-means clustering to distinguish between Leads and Sea Ice.
   - Visualize and analyze cluster separation.

3. Computation of Echo Shapes
   - Calculate average echo shape and standard deviation for each class.
   
4. Validation with ESA Classification
   - Compare our results with ESAâ€™s official classification using a confusion matrix.
   - Compute performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

For this assignement, we will be utilising two very common clustering types, K-means clustering and Gausssian Mixture Models (GMM) clustering. Here are some brief explanation on both clustering methods:

## K-means clustering 
K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm capable of splitting complex datasets into several k groups, where k represents the number of groups pre-specified by the analyst. It classifies the data points based on the similarity of the features of the data (macqueen1967some). The basic idea is to define k centroids, one for each cluster, and then assign each data point to the nearest centroid, while keeping the centroids as small as possible.

## Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are a probabilistic model for representing normally distributed subpopulations within an overall population. The model assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, each with its own mean and variance (reynolds2009gaussian; mclachlan2004finite). GMMs are widely used for clustering and density estimation, as they provide a method for representing complex distributions through the combination of simpler ones.

## GMM clustering on Sentinel-2 data

We can observe that in this case, GMM cluster does a much better job than k-means cluster at classfying sea-ice and leads for Sentinel-2 optical data.

## Mean and standard deviation of sea-ice and lead
